# Proteomics-Toolkit
A web application toolkit designed to facilitate mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Highlight ***proteomics/peptidomics*** *in silico* computations and output.  

## Peptide Analysis:  
 * Calculate monoisotopic mass of user-specified peptide sequence from +1 to +5 charge state  
 * Display amino acid composition  
 * Incorporate PTMs with various forms  
 * Simulate *in silico* isotopic distribution with given peptide sequence (plus PTMs)  
 
 **Shown below is an example of the simulated isotopic distribution.**

## Protein Analysis:  
 * Generate table corresponding to monoisotopic mass of protein with user-defined charge state range  
 * Consider both fixed modification and variable modifications  
 * Perform *in silico* protein digestion & generate resulting peptide list  
 * Compute for & output ***inclusion m/z list*** with user-defined chemical labelings for ***DDA Targeted Analysis***
